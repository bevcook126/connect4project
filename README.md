# Connect 4

Versions of Connect 4 date back thousands of years, entertaining sea-bound sailors. The Connect 4 we know today became a sensation in the 1970s when it was distributed by Milton Bradley, and is still sold today by Hasbro. 

In my version of Connect 4, players will compete using their chosen pizza toppings as tokens. A winner will be determined when 4 or more of the same pizza topping are lined up consecutively in a row, column, or on a diagonal. In a physical version of Connect 4, the player drops their token from the top of a chosen column, letting gravity take it to the next available slot. In my version, small slices of pizza at the top of the board represent each column, and upon clickin them, the player drops their topping in that chosen column.

## Next Steps

#### Future Enhancements:

- **Animation upon determination of a winner:** a future goal for this game is to make the winner feel as though they've entered a pizza party. When a player wins, I want to show confetti on the screen (a la the winning pizza topping).

- **Sound effects during gameplay:** audio plays once a winner is determined, but to make the game more engaging, I want to add audio for dropping toppings on the board.
